# This script is a demo for controlling a USB relay board using Python.
# Please feel welcome to use and adapt it as you wish.
#
# The script has been developed and tested using an LCUS-4 board,
# which has a USB to serial port chip ('CH340T') manufactured by 
# Nanjing Qinheng Microelectronics Co., Ltd. (https://www.wch-ic.com/)
# The board itself possibly manufactured by 'EC Buying'.
#
# The script should also work with other boards, such as the LCUS-1, LCUS-2 and
# LCUS-8.  If you find others that work, please let me know.
